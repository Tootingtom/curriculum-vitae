\section{Summary}   
I am a Computer Engineer since 2011, but I started programming long time before that. I have always been learning new things and I can do it very quickly. I started studying PHP at home when I was 13, since that, I never stopped using it. During the college and internships I learned other programming languages, such as C/C++, Java and Lua.

I’ve been working long time as a freelancer developer and most of the time involving web development, as a result I became an experienced web developer with big expertise in PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

In my spare time I’ve contributed in many open source projects like Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), Zend Framework, Backbone.js, luasofia and luanotify.

I worked in many companies with several technologies and it made me an open minded developer, with can-do attitude and a good interpersonal relationship. Currently I’m working as Full Stack Developer in south Brazil, but looking for new challenges around the world.
